# Neural Nets & Deep Learning Project
Prediction Of Repayment Of Loan using TensorFlow2.0 &amp; Kera's 

Problem Statement:
Prediction Of Repayment Of Loan based on Historical Data

Objective:<br>
Given historical data on loans given out with information on whether or not the borrower defaulted (charge-off), build an ANN model that can predict wether or not a borrower will pay back their loan. 

Following Conclusion can be drawn from this Project:<br>
If in future, when we get a new potential customer we can assess or predict whether or not they are likely to pay back the loan based on their historical Data.

Note: 

(A)Keep in mind classification metrics when evaluating the performance of the model!<br>
(B)The "loan_status" column contains the label!
